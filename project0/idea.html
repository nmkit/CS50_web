            <h2 class="heading" id="h2_bkgd">Background</h2>
            <p>After years of work and effort to equip myself for living, I want to put my life back into my hand
                instead of being paid by others to work on their goals.
                <br>I have thing that I care; I have impact I want to make to my society in short and long-term.
                I thought about what I can do for those with my knowledge.

            <h2 class="heading" id="h2_prob">Market Problem</h2>
            <p>Hong Kong has one of the most active property market in the world.
                However, an active market does not naturally represent a transparent and information symmetric market for buyer and seller.
                Coupled with the sad situation that HK has been ranked the worldâ€™s least-affordable housing market for the 10th year by <a href="http://www.demographia.com/">Demographia</a>,
                purchasing a flat usually not only use up all the saving of a young couple but also put them in large debt burden
                which trap them from chasing their dream.
                Even worse is that property puchase is inherently an information assymetric eercise with the seller always having a much better understnding of the property(in term of physical properties and encumbrances) than the buyer
                In a seller market of the past years and the inherent nature of agent in fighting for a higher price's comission, agents may not disclose unfavorable condition of the property.
                <br>
                I felt furious to the market reality that the system is inclined to one side.
                I want to help make a change by providing more assistance to he buyer for them in making a better informed decision.
            <h2 class="heading" id="h2_solu">My Plan</h2>
            <p>
                The first thing I can think of is providng  free residential property valuation system deploying my domain knowledge in valuation
                and the transaction data of the past 20 years.
                <br>
                In view of that, I self-learnt python, extended my secondary statistics knowledge with machine learning algorithm and learning web development to put it for public use.
